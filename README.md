The practitioners of "data-driven storytelling" produce narratives from data analysis and statistical reasoning, with the underlying belief that empirical objectivity is vital for an informed and just society.

**Story-driven Data** shares that high goal, but uses research and life experience to drive the methods for data inquiry. This comes from the firm conviction that data has *no* special authority or claim to truth; rather, data is as inherently flawed and corrupted as the humans and human-driven systems that seek to compile it.
